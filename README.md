# Rock vs Mine Prediction
A machine learning project to classify whether a given input is a rock or a mine using sonar dataset analysis. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for binary classification tasks.
# Features
<li>Data loading and preprocessing.</li>
Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Model training using supervised machine learning.
Performance evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

# Results
The trained model achieves X% accuracy (replace with actual value) on the test dataset.
Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
